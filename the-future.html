                    The Artemis missions are NASA's attempt at bringing humanity back to the moon. They're named after
                    Artemis, the greek goddess of the moon, twin sister of Apollo. It pays homage to the Apollo missions
                    of the past while still opening a new chapter of space exploration. Artemis will land the first
                    woman and person of colour on the moon, and work to build a long term home there.

                    The SpaceX starship is a spacecraft designed to be able to launch, land, and fly again, making space
                    travel cheaper and more sustainable. Much like modern airplanes, these spacecraft will be able to be
                    quickly refurbished and relaunched rather than having to be entirely discarded. It aims to achieve
                    this with a fully reuable booster and Starship spacecraft that can carry crew and cargo. These
                    rockets could revolutionise space exploration and usher in a new space age of unprecedented scale.

                    Human Mars missions aim to send astronauts to the Red Planet for the first time, marking a giant
                    leap in space exploration. These missions will involve long-duration spaceflight, advanced life
                    support systems, and habitats that can protect crews from harsh conditions. NASA's Artemis program
                    and SpaceX's Starship are helping pave the way. The goal is to explore Mars's surface, search for
                    signs of life, and lay the groundwork for a long-term human presence on another world.

                    Asteroid mining is the idea of extracting valuable resources like metals, water, and minerals from
                    asteroids in space. These materials could support space industries, provide fuel for missions, or
                    even supply rare metals for use on Earth. Companies and space agencies are exploring technologies
                    for locating, capturing, and processing asteroids. Mining in space could reduce the need to launch
                    heavy materials from Earth and help build a sustainable space economy, supporting future exploration
                    of the Moon, Mars, and beyond.
